DEEP LEARNING AND DATA ANALYTICS LABORATORY Experiments (Works better on Google Colab)

<p><h3>1. Implement Convolution and pooling operations of CNN.</h3>
    A simple program to implement the basic operations of Convulation and max pooling operations of image data and see the working of it.</p>
<p><h3>2. Build a Convolution Neural Network using Transfer learning.</h3>
    To understand the working of transfer learning on by using saved weights of a pretrained model on our custom CNN model.</p>
<p><h3>3. Build a Convolution Neural Network for Neural Style Transfer.</h3>
    To understand the working of a neural style transfer to stylize an image based on the features extracted from another image using pre trained CNN model.</p>
<p><h3>4. Build a Convolution Neural Network for object detection.</h3>
    To understand the working of  basic object detection using a pretrained model from tensorflow hub.</p>
<p><h3>5. Implement forward and backward pass in RNN</h3>
    To understand the working of an RNN model with forward and backward pass in a RNN layer for classification of IMDB reviews.</p>
<p><h3>6. Build a LSTM model</h3>
    To understand the working of an LSTM cell and how the flow of a text classification is done based on a sentiment data of IMDB reviews dataset.</p>
<p><h3>7. Build a simple Auto encoder</h3>
    To understand the working of an AutoEncoder while building a simple image reconstruction model using the basic autoencoder architecture</p>
